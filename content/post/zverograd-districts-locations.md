In a Zverograd campaign, each battle will take place in a specific location. when you submit a result for your battle you always have to include the location. Below is a description of those locations. The unleashing of the Mythos might have made some areas less accessible, the information will be made available as the campaign progresses.

The map of Zverograd consists of twenty-seven locations. These locations are separated into districts. When planning terrain for your battle you can take inspiration from the description of the location. Not every location in Zverograd is an urban built-up area, you have open spaces and vegetation-filled areas too. By the time of the Return to Zverograd campaign, buildings with surviving floors beyond the ground floor is almost non-existent.

### Airfield
The first location to fall in the Axis assault on Zverograd, the airfield has since changed hands a few times. The Airfield is currently seeing its most use as an air drop zone. Situated on the near outskirts of Zverograd, air dropped supplies can be moved quickly from the Airfield into the city over Red Bridge. The Airfield is also used as a place to muster troops in preparation for large-scale assaults on key locations in the heart of Zverograd.

### Harbor
What was once a thriving port on the Caspian Sea has been brought low by the war. The Harbor has been cut off from access to the sea since the Axis took over Red Bridge and mined the waters beneath. Control of this location would dramatically improve certain bloc’s prospects in Zverograd.

### North Bridge
Aside from Red Bridge, North Bridge is the only crossing that passes over the harbor, or the river that feeds it, for nearly sixty kilometers. Smaller and less grandiose by far than Red Bridge, North Bridge is nevertheless a crucial gateway into the city of Zverograd.

### Railway Yard
Although it is not strictly inside the city, the Railway Yard is one of the most desperately contested locations in the battle for Zverograd.

### Red Bridge
Zverograd’s Red Bridge was a marvel of engineering that showcased the work of the Soviet Union’s finest architects. Its two-tier construction provided roads for motor vehicles and pedestrians above, and metro tracks below, and was situated far enough above the water to allow all but the tallest of cargo ships to pass beneath it.

### Memorial Park
This park long predates the construction of Zverograd in the 1930s, and was one of the most beautiful in the region, with centuries-old trees. On Sundays, local orchestras would play outdoor concerts under a tent for citizens to enjoy. The park also had an extensive flower collection, and was the most colorful place in Zverograd, second only to the Botanical Garden.

### Zverograd Central Station
A major transit hub, Zverograd Central Station was built to connect the city with the rest of Russia and, ultimately, the SSU as a whole. Of modern design, it was one of the most advanced rail buildings in the world before the fighting began. The Station featured beautiful marble walls inlaid with sweeping mosaics of polished stone and colored glass, but it was bombed heavily during the invasion. The blasts created gaping new access points in the building’s façade, while blocking old entrances with rubble. These jagged openings are often used to launch bloody surprise assaults on the defenders inside the Station.

The siege has not been kind to the station. Heavy bombing has wreaked terrible damage on the building, creating gaping new entrances, blasting new passageways through the walls and sealing up old corridors with rubble. The many entrances into the station from the metro and sewers make the station almost impossible to defend effectively. These underground access routes are now used to launch surprise attacks into the heart of the station, to devastating effect.

### Soviet Square
Nearby Soviet Square was designed to evoke Moscow’s Red Square, but in a city already filled with symbols of the Revolution it was derided as a cheap copy. Its importance as a strategic objective has increased, however, as the Axis have established their regional operational headquarters in the heart of the square. Originally established in Memorial Park, the HQ was moved eastward as the Axis push extended deeper into the city. A wide open space filled with large trees and small structures, Memorial Park had left Axis forces vulnerable to attack from nearly all sides. The taller structures surrounding Soviet Square proved excellent for setting a defensive perimeter.

### Great Hotel of the Red Flag
Before the war, the Great Hotel of the Red Flag was famous throughout the USSR for its gigantic flagpole, which bore one of the largest Communist Party flags in the world. The flag wasn’t removed in time to prevent its capture when Axis forces entered the city, an event that is still considered a mark of shame by many SSU soldiers fighting in the city. The hotel was a major social hub for Zverograd’s elite, and was the place where dignitaries would stay while visiting the city. SSU leader Joseph Stalin stayed at the Great Hotel of the Red Flag during both of his official visits to Zverograd.

### GUM
The GUM was the largest department store in Zverograd, and is a much smaller replica of its counterpart in Moscow. Most of its shops have been plundered repeatedly, and are littered with empty shelves. Many of the interior walls are adorned with beautiful murals, but most have been badly damaged by the fighting. Little remains of the amazing architectural decoration of the original building. Worst of all, when the ground trembles, bits of glass rain down from the once magnificent skylight that served as the structure’s roof. More than a few soldiers have been killed by these falling shards of glass.

### Central Hospital
Occupying an entire city block, Central Hospital is one of the most prominent structures along October Revolution Avenue. It remains standing, but major sections have been utterly destroyed. The first wave of Luftwaffe bombers were unfazed by the huge red cross painted on Central Hospital’s white roof, with many treating it more like a bullseye than a deterrent.

### October Revolution Avenue
From the Headquarters of the Communist Party, October Revolution Avenue stretches one and a half kilometers to the northeast. It is the longest and widest of Zverograd’s streets, and was once the city’s main artery. Before the siege, it was a delightful promenade; the avenue was lined with fully grown trees transplanted from the neighboring countryside. It featured many charming shops, cafes and restaurants, and was home to the regional offices of many Soviet government agencies.

Today, it is a corridor of death that no soldier dares to cross, even under cover of night. Antitank guns command the entire length of the avenue, and the ruins of the beautiful buildings that made this area of the city famous are now infested with sniper nests.

### Communist Party HQ
This location was bitterly defended by SSU forces, who refused to let such an ideological symbol fall into enemy hands. It was soon transformed into a redoubt under the command of Senior Sergeant Yakov Pavlov of the 10th SSU Rifle Division. Under his command, the entire structure was fortified with sandbags, barbed wire and traps, and a machine gun or antitank gun was stationed at every window.

Despite its constant bombardment, the Headquarters of the Communist Party is still standing. From without, it appears to have suffered minimal damage when compared with Zverograd’s other buildings. Inside, however, it has been largely destroyed by the constant waves of assaulting troops.

### Victory Plaza
Victory Plaza was once the jewel of Zverograd, a place where visitors would come to see the sights and where couples would go for romantic walks. At its center stands the massive Victory Obelisk, a landmark known throughout the SSU and a defining symbol of Zverograd. Built as a monument to Soviet soldiers who fought in Finland in 1939, the obelisk has weathered so much gunfire that it looks eaten by termites; the names engraved upon the stone are now impossible to read.

### Power Plant
In the early stages of the Axis invasion of Zverograd, the Power Plant was the last to fall, and the first to be retaken by the SSU Army. The intense fighting has left the plant looking more like huge piles of rubble than an actual structure. The Axis had wanted to repair the plant to use for its own benefit, but couldn’t hold it long enough to do so. When the SSU retook control, they managed to get the facility up and running, but its output is far inferior to that of pre-invasion days.

### Tank Factory
Zverograd’s Tank Factory once held the SSU’s production record for making the T-34 tanks used on the Eastern Front, but its importance to the SSU is now largely symbolic. Due to its vital role in providing for the defense of the city, it was extensively bombed during the invasion and little is left of this once-proud building.

### City Stadium
The City Stadium provides a convenient location for mustering troops in preparation for large assaults. However, it is almost impossible to defend the stadium effectively; there are too many exits, too many places for snipers to hide, and troops inside its grounds are hard pressed to find any cover. Troops from all blocs have taken to calling it the “blood arena,” as surprise attacks launched against regrouping units have left the frozen ground of the stadium’s central field trampled, pitted and stained with red. Deemed a high risk objective with only limited strategic value, it is usually lightly garrisoned. It occasionally proves useful, however, as a platform for observing enemy troop movements.

### Revolution Park
Before the war, inhabitants of Zverograd would go to Revolution Park to engage in all manner of recreational activities, the most common of which being sunbathing or playing soccer in the park’s wide grassy fields. When SSU forces tried to build a small airfield in the middle of the park, enemy artillery fire devastated the area, incinerating the vegetation and transforming the park’s grassy expanses into an eerie lunar landscape. Its stark lack of cover has made the park into a killing field. It typically remains uncontested, except for when attacked as smaller step in a larger assault aimed against more valuable objectives, such as the Tank or Tractor Factories.

### Tractor Factory
The symbol of the SSU’s industrial might, the Tractor Factory was the only industrial complex never to fall into enemy hands during the first invasion of Zverograd. Its defenders held out against incredible odds for more than ten days, until a relieving SSU army could come from the north.

### Botanical Garden
The thicker vegetation in the Botanical Gardens precludes air drops, but the dense trees and shrubs provide plenty of cover for newly air dropped troops. After landing in Central Park, reinforcements must make a hazardous dash north across open terrain to reach the relative safety of the Botanical Gardens.

### Municipal Zoo
Sadly, the original residents of the zoo are long gone. When the fighting spilled into the city, the zoo staff were assigned to more urgent duties and the animals were left to starve. A few dedicated volunteers braved the shelling to care for the abandoned creatures, but food shortages quickly caused Zverograd’s citizens to suffer as well. Of the animals that survived the stressful conditions brought about by the war, many were killed by soldiers or civilians desperate to fend off starvation.

### Central Park
Central Park was once lush and green, a quiet place where the citizens of Zverograd could go to relax or reflect in peace. Now it is a blasted battlefield. The sounds of chirping birds and children at play have been replaced by those of exploding mortars and machine gun fire.

Fighting has been particularly fierce in Zverograd’s Central Park, the only downtown area where air drops of men and supplies can be conducted with relative safety. A drop zone of immense value to all three blocs, control of Central Park has been bitterly contested.

### Lighthouse
Zverograd’s eastern coast is controlled by the Allies, from Old Fisherman Village in the south to the Tsaristera lighthouse in the north. From this lighthouse, the Rangers launch raids into contested areas of the city. The crossing from the coastal districts to the outskirts of Zverograd itself is difficult, as snipers are stationed along all the approaches to the city, so the Rangers begin each raid by softening up their enemies with suppressive artillery fire. The sweeping view of the city from atop the lighthouse has proven invaluable to the coordination of Allied attacks.

### Old Fisherman Village
Old Fisherman Village was built centuries before the monastery. Nearly two thousand years ago, the areas first settlers built their village in a sheltered cove from which they could exploit the rich fishing on the Caspian Sea. The small community thrived for centuries, sheltered from much of Russia’s turbulent history.

## Market Square
armers and merchants from across the SSU once traveled to Zverograd to trade in its famous Market Square. This trade was largely spurred by the city’s location as a major crossroads in the transportation network of the SSU, and made Zverograd quite wealthy. Local merchants vied with each other to build the most beautiful houses possible along the streets surrounding the market, showcasing their wealth and success.

Though the Revolution frowned upon this kind of bourgeois excess, few gloated at seeing the magnificent homes razed to the ground. As phosphorus shells rained down on Market Square, the timbered houses went up like kindling. All that remains now are a few half-burned beams, rising jaggedly from among the cinders.

### Orthodox Monastery
Transcriptions of the area’s ancient oral tradition claim that the Monastery of Saint Petrov was built on the remains of older religious structures of an unearthly architecture. These were destroyed by leaders in the Orthodox faith, who considered them pagan at best, and demonic at worst, but the ancient writings hint at one structure that was so powerful that even pious faith could not destroy or alter it. The only option left to the builders of the monastery was to bury it deep within the hidden crypts below the monastery. The way in to the crypts has long been forgotten, so these stories remain unverified...

### Old Town
Zverograd’s Old Town was constructed from lumber from nearby forests, and the wooden structures have stood for hundreds of years. The skillfully crafted buildings were once famous across Russia, and people would travel great distances to attend the town’s annual Easter festival.

Little now remains of Old Town, let alone the entire Old Town District. The fires of Old Town’s destruction were visible for miles, and there were extensive casualties. The ash-covered grey waste is now one of the deadliest battlefields in Zverograd. Open lanes of fire stretch across a deadly no man’s land littered with obstacles hidden by the thick layer of ash, threatening to trip up squads of soldiers as they move from one meager scrap of cover to the next. Armored vehicles frequently accompany offensives in this area, to supply the troops with covering fire as they attempt to cross this wasteland and reach the monastery beyond.
