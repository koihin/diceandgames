Last week I decided to retire my original Dust dice, the black 16mm ones that came with the first edition of Dust Tactics, lasted through a few iterations including Dust Warfare and finally supplanted in Dust Tactics 2.0 in 2013/2014, even then you could still use the older dice for most rolls, only the ones that needed 3 results from a die needed the new dice.

That prompted me to think about why I like Dust dice so much and why I think more games should consider this design for dice.

First, what's special about old Dust dice (and this includes the new ones too). The six-sided dice does not have six different faces, in fact, it only has two (three on the current ones), 4 faces are blank, while the remaining two has a target symbol. The genius is putting the symbols on the opposite face of the dice. Doing so eliminates a potential problem with dice in general.

Ever felt like in some games that use your more typical six-sided dice they roll some results more than others? It might just be confirmation bias on your part or they really be showing some faces more than others. In the latter case, this is due to the dice not being perfect cubes and the irregularity makes a face turn face up more than others. To some degree this is true of most dice, outside of casino-grade dice, most dice aren't machined to a level of precision that you can guarantee the the effect is negligible for most purposes. Even a small deviance of 5% can result in significantly skewed results over many dice rolls.

Dust dice on the other hand don't suffer from this problem even though they aren't machined any better. They do it by making the opposite face the exact same symbol. Let me explain.

When a typical d6 is irregular and more likely to show the 'six' face for example, it also means correspondingly the opposite face, in this case the 'one' shows up less, to the same degree. So if 6 is showing up 10% more than expected, this means 'one' is showing up 10% less than expected as it is the face that is opposite.

But with Dust dice if a particular face shows up more often, it means the corresponding face opposite shows up less, again by the same degree. This means the result of the symbol showing is as expected by the dice (33.3.% in this case) don't deviate as the opposite faces cancels out!

So Dust dice, by design of the placement of the symbols on the face, are balanced without the requirement of them being mechanically balanced.

While my old Dust Tactics dice may be retired from Dust duty they are not retired from the game just yet! They make handy markers for smoke, just place them where the smoke is, first Turn let the Target face-up. Next Turn, turn it to the blank side.
