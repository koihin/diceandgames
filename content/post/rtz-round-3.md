## The story so far...
Story from Round 1 [here]({{< ref "/post/rtz-round-2" >}}).

The third round saw no abatement of fighting that has started, now company sized battles dominate, entire battalions get deployed to retake districts.

The big event was the air battle over Zverograd, centred around the Old Quarter, where a combined Allies-Axis air force baited the flying monsters airborne and proceeded to firebomb their roosting grounds with a new incendiary weapon that burned for so long the creatures which could not sustain flight for long now returned to see their nests burning. Even as they tire and fell out of the sky, highly manoeuvrable jet-fighters of both Allies and Axis forces took on any of them that tried to leave the area. After 3 waves of jetfighters, the sky grew quiet as mi-gos fell out of the sky to the burning ground or some chose to perish over the sea. For the first time since June, the air over Zverograd is not dominated flying creatures out of nightmare.

The SSU were equal part indignant and excited they were not consulted in this joint exercise, but saw an opportunity to capitalise on the situation by bringing in their own troop carriers in an attempt to quickly drop paratroopers to retake key areas. It was not to be as Axis AA guns long planned were moved in position and caused enough damage the mission was aborted.

It is unclear if all the flying creatures were destroyed, half-dead bodies kept being found in different parts of Zverograd, but for now all three major blocks were committing themselves to bring in air support.

The IJN mounted lightning strikes against mostly SSU locations, but somewhat frustratingly to the SSU they seem not intend on holding on to any location in particular. Reports are made of the day after the IJN successfully occupied a location, they seemingly disappeared leaving behind no trace, not even their rubbish. Fear of boobie-traps proved unfound, but rumours persist the IJN never left the area, and stories of ghosts at night abound and of sentries garotted as they stood watch. Intelligence indicate the IJN took part in the air battle over Zverograd in some fashion, exactly how they have not been able to determine it.

The Allies were active once more and the repaired Zverograd airfield were a staging ground for part of the air battle, with planes landing to be re-fueled and re-supplied before taking off again record time. The few Mi-Gos that flapped all the way over to the air field were taken care of by defensive AA guns.
