## Saves in Dust 1947

A Save is a target unit's reaction to Hits. Unless otherwise noted, Saves of the same type do not stack; example, you cannot get Evade and Improved Evade Save.

If a unit gets Cover Save, you do not get Evade or Infantry Save. Cover and Evade/Infantry Saves are mutually exclusive (you can get both Evade and infantry Save at the same time).

E.g. A Sturmgrenadier squad is currently behind Cover and is within a smoke screen. The smoke provides an Evade Save but as he is getting the Cover Save he does not receive the Evade Save and Infantry Save. If the unit were to be Hit by a weapon that negates Cover, they will get the Evade Save and Infantry Save.

When a weapon negates a type of Save, ignore the Save entirely, the Hit goes through. When a weapon reduces a type of Improved Save, it saves only on a [BLOC].

Here are the six types of Saves in Dust 1947 (Structural and Improved Structural Save are campaign specific).

**Evade Save**
*Evade Save do not apply if you have Cover Save.* The player rolls a die for each Hit their Target Unit received. Each [BLOC] rolled negates one Hit. Evade Save happens before Infantry Save.

**Improved Evade Save**
*Improved Evade Save do not apply if you have Cover Save.* The player rolls a die for each Hit their Target Unit received. Each [BLOC] or [SHIELD] rolled negates one Hit. Improved Evade Save happens before Infantry Save.

**Cover Save**
For an Infantry Unit in Cover, the player rolls a die for each Hit their Target Infantry Unit received. Each [BLOC] or [SHIELD] rolled negates one Hit.

For a Vehicle Unit in Cover, the player rolls a die for each Hit their Target Vehicle Unit received. Each [BLOC] rolled negates one Hit.

**Infantry Save**
An Infantry Unit that is not in Cover receives an Infantry Save. This Save represents the ability of Infantry to "hit the dirt" or dive to the ground to avoid incoming fire. The player rolls a die for each Hit their Target Unit received. Each [BLOC] rolled negates one Hit.

**Structural Save**
Structural Save is attempted after Cover/Infantry Save. The player rolls a die for each Hit their Target Unit received. Each [BLOC] rolled negates one Hit.

**Improved Structural Save**
Improved Structural Save is attempted after Cover/Infantry Save. The player rolls a die for each Hit their Target Unit received. Each [BLOC] or [SHIELD] rolled negates one Hit.

What follows is a reference of how the various weapon categories interact with Saves.

**Railguns**
Negate all Saves except Evade and Improved Evade Save.

**Sniper weapons**
Negate all Saves except Evade and Improved Evade Save.

**Phaser Weapons**
Negate Evade, Cover and Structural. Reduced Improved Evade Save and Improved Structural Save.

**Flame Weapons** (including Flame Burst)
Negate Cover, Infantry, Structural and Improved Structural Save.

**Artillery**
Negate Infantry, Evade and Improved Evade Save.

**Close Combat**
Negate Evade, Cover, Infantry, Structural and Improved Structural Save.  Improved Evade is reduced to saving only on [BLOC].


**Smoke Screen**
All units within a Smoke Screen gain Evade Save (instead of Cover Save).





A note on phasers, this is how phasers are currently described as working in the Dust 1947 universe, hence why phasers negates Structural and reduces Improved Structural Saves:

*Allied research into VK-powered Weapons started later than that of the Axis and took a very different path. Allied researchers developed a method of generating a coherent ball of chaotic energy that could be directed at a Target. It is impossible to build armour capable of stopping a full-power Phaser Weapon. Even a concrete wall just melts away, providing no cover to a Target Unit attempting to use it for shelter.*
