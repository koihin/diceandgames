## Known Axis Forces present at Zverograd at the end of August, 1947

Army Group “West Asia” - 11th Axis Army
- 33rd Panzer Division
- 2nd FußPanzer Grenadier Division
- 4th Blutkreuz Korps Kommando

*The divisions are shells of their former selves. Depleted companies are not replenished. The division HQs are waiting for the order to abandon the city entirely, but the order has yet to come in.*

Smaller than division level forces may not be tracked, an example would be forces from NDAK. When creating the backstory for your force you are free to create one that you think fit the narrative. Most forces will be at Platoon size, but remember, you can be at the core of a company not fully represented on the tabletop but appears in your story.

Normal army list building rules applies for all factions unless otherwise stated.

## Improved Powered Armour
*Axis engineers have improved on the heavy VK powered armour to improve the survivability of the suits.*

All Heavy Grenadiers, including Laser Grenadiers in powered armour gain [Structural Save]({{< ref "/post/dust-unified-saves" >}}).

They also gain Large Combat Knife which does 2/1 versus Infantry class 1 and 2, and 1/1 against 3 and 4. No effects on Vehicles or Aircrafts (obviously).



## Gorillas
*The Axis sentient Gorillas have learned to embrace their full primal ferocity while retaining their ability to make tactical decisions.*

All Gorillas of armour class 2 are now class 3.

## Bloc veterans
*Those troops of the Battle of Zverograd who arrived in January are hardened veterans and are ruthlessly efficient in manpower allocation. Most can't wait to leave the doomed city before they are killed or worse.*

If building an Axis Bloc army (75% bloc, no faction units), the faction bonus is 15% instead of 10%, any fraction is rounded up.

## Upgraded Walkers

*Through field experience, the engineers have improved the Axis walkers to stand up against formidable opponents.*

The following two modifications apply to Axis Panzerkamplaufers walkers (class 4 and 5) only. Examples are the Luther, Ludwig, Jagdluther

**Reinforced:** when targeted by ranged weapons in the front arc, treat your armour class as one higher, i.e. class 4 is 5, class 5 is 6.

**Hit them Harder:** Applies to primary weapon of range 14 or greater and is not a Special Weapon (Artillery, Laser, etc). When the weapon's target is a Vehicle (not Aircraft or Infantry) and is at half or lower than weapon's stated range, gain **Penetrating**. Applies to this weapon only.

(Penetrating: When target is at half or lower than the stated Range of this weapon, treat target as one armour class lower.)

## Platoons
All platoons are available if you can legally build them. You can have multiple platoons in your force (but must always include your Core Platoon).

[New Elite Laser Grenadier Platoon.]({{< ref "/post/elite-laser-grenadier-platoon" >}})

**Axis Sturmgrenadier Platoon Alternative Platoon Advantage** - The Platoon Leader may perform a Get Moving You Bunch of Monkeys Special Action targeting a Sturmgrenadier Unit in or supporting the Platoon as a free third Action each time it Activates, it succeeds on a [BLOC] and [TARGET] symbol.

## Hero Archetypes
Here is the list of Heroes you may choose as your commander (if it is the command unit of your Core Platoon) or add to your army list. Remember to rename them for the stories! If a Hero is not on the list, you would have to request for it from HQ.

- Grenadier X
- Kurt
- Lara
- Manfred
- Raketenmann
- Rolf
