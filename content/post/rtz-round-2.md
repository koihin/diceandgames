## The story so far...
Story from Round 1 [here]({{< ref "/post/rtz-round-1" >}}).

The second round of conflicts grew in size, where previously platoon-sized skirmishes dominated, now whole companies engaged in battle.

The IJN produced new combatants seemingly out of thin air, as their numbers appear undiminished despite no apparent logistical support. Reports that they are employing some mercenary forces now have been confirmed, although the extent of that was uncertain.

What was clear was the Allies appear to be have temporarily halted their offensive and there are rumours of a temporary cease-fire. None of the other Blocs attempted to push into Allies held territory. Observers noted increased activity in the old Zverograd Airfield, tarmacs were repaired, and potholes filled,

The SSU continued to be tenacious opponents, holding on to their territories even as they attempted to push into Axis strongholds, the Great Hotel of the Red Flag again the focus as both sides attempted to hold this symbolic location. So too did the Soviet Square remain in SSU hands after vicious fighting with Axis forces.

The Red Army re-took Revolution Park and Victory Plaza, widely seen as the next step to gain control over the People's District and Park's District.

Control of North Bridge went to the Axis after a particularly bloody conflict, but being so near to the Mythos infested Zverograd Central Station, it is unclear if this was a strategic move.

Coincidentally the various heretical cults appear to have gone underground, to what purpose is unknown, but there are reliable sources that suggest there is significant infighting among them.

On a cold dawn in early September, the roar of a full squadron of Axis VTOL jet-fighters could be heard headed directly for the historical district where the Mi-Go winged terrors nested. As were their wont, the Mi-Gos sluggishly took flight at approaching Aircrafts and flapped towards them to engage. The highly manoeuvrable aircrafts began to weave and turn to avoid the Mi-Gos while strafing the ground, rousing more of the vile creatures to rise. As more and more Mi-gos took to the air, it became clear to ground observers the jet-fighters were attempting to lure the Mi-Gos away from the airspace above the Historical District.

At that moment a swarm of Allies P48s came in low over the Caspian Sea, skimming just above the jagged upper floors of the ruined buildings like gigantic dragonflies. Eagle-eyed persons would have further noted they appeared to be carrying unfamiliar payloads. The coordinated attempt to re-take the airspace over Zverograd had begun...
