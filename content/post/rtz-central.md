Welcome to RTZ campaign central, where we get you into the game and update you on the progress of the battle for the doomed city!

## Map of Zverograd - At the Start of Round 3
We are now into Round 3 of the RTZ campaign and things are heating up! 
{{< figure src="/images/zverograd-round-2.png" link="/images/zverograd-round-1.png">}}
Here is the map at the start of the Round. The bloc symbol shows who controls each location. If a location does not have a symbol it means no bloc dominates the location yet.

Read about the [locations]({{< ref "/post/zverograd-districts-locations" >}}) you will be fighting over.

You can see the previous rounds as they become available.

## Round 2
[Results]({{< ref "/post/rtz-round-2" >}}) from Round 2 are out!


## Round 1
[Results]({{< ref "/post/rtz-round-1" >}}) from Round 1 are out!


Here are suggested [missions]({{< ref "/post/rtz-missions-round-1" >}}) format to start you playing! Skirmish is a good size to start with. Remember you can always come up with your own scenarios, do share them with us if you do! See Missions below about locations.

There are no additional rules for Round 1.

## Missions
All verified results submitted by players are presented here in different tabular format. See who is the commander that has gone on the most missions, who has the most wins (if you are into that sort of thing), who has the most medals, etc.

Most Missions will happen at a specific location in Zverograd. Refer to the current map as above. Choose a location accessible to both you and your opponent. Defender is determined by who currently controls the location. Otherwise determine it randomly. For ideas on how to setup a scenario for a location see above but you can always create your own based on the location you are fighting over! Sportsmanship should always prevail, when in doubt give the advantage to your opponent rather than yourself.

## Getting started with RTZ
First step is to [sign up](https://forms.gle/qng9wfbqeB86rQwL8)! It is perfectly fine that the campaign is underway, you don't have to play every Round! Play as much (or little) as you wish! Round 1 starts 15 December 2020 and goes on for six weeks/rounds!

## Create your RTZ commander and force
You need an RTZ legal force to go on missions. [Find out here.]({{< ref "/post/rtz-force-create-build" >}})

## How to play in RTZ (Each Round)
1. Arrange to play with an opponent in a mutually agreed Zverograd location according to the rules.
2. Create a mission based on the situation (location, weather, etc).
3. Play the mission, note down the result.
4. Submit the mission result (instructions will be given).
5. Write a kick-ass battle report with photos and submit to the COs (optional).

## Special Rules for RTZ
Most of the [special rules]({{< ref "/post/rtz-special-rules" >}}) here have been play-tested over a long period and we believe they will enhance your enjoyment of the game, we hope you enjoy them!

## Frequently Asked Questions
We will be posting and updating this FAQ as we get the questions!

#### Q1. I am not familiar with background of Zverograd/I want a refresher/Zverograd sounds amazing, where can I read more about it?
Ans: Start [here]({{< ref "/post/battle-for-zverograd-part-1" >}}) with this short series on the history of the doomed city till start of campaign.

#### Q2. Is RTZ for the gridded version of Dust 1947? I prefer to play freeform, is this allowed?
Ans: Yes, of course! gridded or free-form, whichever you prefer! We support both modes of play. In fact if you wish to use alternative rulesets like Dust Warfare as well, please do! You will need to spend more effort to make the missions compatible and more importantly, all players have a good time.

#### Q3. Most of the players are in XYZ country, how can I possibly take part?
Ans: The campaign doesn't require you to play with any specific player, only the players you can reach. All you need is at least 1 player you can contact and you are good to go!

#### Q4. I have some ideas for better mission scenarios, can I play those?
Ans: Yes of course! Even better, contact us with your scenarios and ideas and we will see if we can fit them into later rounds of the campaign!  

#### Q5. Can I play multiple games and submit them separately each campaign round?
Ans: Yes, provided they are with different commanders. Does this mean you can't play mulitple games with the same commander each week? Yes, you can play multiple linked games with the same player but you submit it as one result, giving your final VP tally across the battles. For example, you might want to play 3 Skirmish size game with a friend in an evening, you won the first game with 10 VPs, lost the second with 6 VPs, and won the last again with 8 VPs, you submit your final result as 10+6+8=24VPs. You indicate you are the Defender or Attacker base on your final battle.

#### Q6. According to the campaign rules, I cannot have more than 3 infantry of the same type unless required by a Platoon to make it legal. Can I deploy two of the same platoon, even though this will require more than 3 of the same infantry type to make both platoons?
Ans: Yes you may, satisfying the requirements of each platoon so that is is legal (and no more). Obviously for those platoons that require a specific Hero as a Command Unit, you can only bring one of each.
