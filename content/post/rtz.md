**September 1947, the doomed city of Zverograd...**
<!--more-->
On the banks of the Caspian Sea, the battle for Zverograd continues unabated. Something has arisen from beneath Zverograd and the dreaded Mythos creatures wreck havoc, terror and chaos. The Imperial Japanese Navy infiltrated two company worth of troops into the city with an agenda of their own. The SSU, Allies and Axis bring fresh reinforcements, still intent on taking the city at all cost... or are they?
