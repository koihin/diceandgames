*We provide missions that we think will be fun and thematic for RTZ and for the round, you are not limited to these missions and in fact we believe our players can come up with better scenarios on their own! Contact us with your scenarios, we would love to feature them! When in doubt, always consult your opponent and arrive at a mutually agreeable scenario, giving the advantage to your opponent if there is any uncertainty like a gentleman!*

## Mission 1 - Another Day in the Doomed City.
{{< figure src="/images/mission-a1-mat.png" link="/images/mission-a1-mat.png">}}
### Description
This is a typical mission and map for Zverograd, the central area is surrounded by buildings (almost all floors are gone by now, and only empty husks of concrete remain), They provide Cover and are overlooking the two objectives (green square with O) of the scenario. The Objectives represent control over the area and you score **Victory Points** (VP) by contesting and controlling them over the course of the game.

### Size of game
This scenario is suitable for Skirmish to Battle size games (40 to 100) with 60-80 being common. It can be used for Patrol as well. Patrol size games tend to be Meeting Engagements and slight modifications may be necessary, such as reducing the Objectives to just 1.

### Deployment
Attacker units enter board from the blue edge. Defender enter the board from the red edge. Standard deployment rules apply (but can be modified as required by the story).

### Terrain
The board has 4 buildings as their main features. The 2 Objectives can be either open space or terrain pieces that provide Cover but should not block Line of Sight nor prevent Vehicles from entering or passing through.

The 2 Objectives are placed in the centre column, each 5 squares away from the deployment edge as in the diagram above.

**Alternative**: To make it easier for the Defender, move both Objectives one square straight down nearer to the Defender deployment edge.

As part of Deployment step, after Initiative, starting with the Player going first, place the following terrain within your half of the board, one terrain piece at a time, alternating between players. You cannot place a terrain piece within a building or with another terrain piece.

Each Player:
- Ammo Crates x 2
- Tank-Trap x 2

**Alternative**: you may allow the Defender to place 2 more pieces of terrain.

**Alternative**: you may substitute up to 2 pieces of terrain for Barbed Wires or Rubble.

### Objective
Players score VP for controlling or contesting the Objectives as follows:
- Turn 1 - no scoring of VPs.
- Turn 2 - Each Controlled Objective is worth 2 VP. Each Contested is worth 1 VP
- Turn 3 - Each Controlled Objective is worth 3 VP. Each Contested is worth 1 VP
- Turn 4 - Each Controlled Objective is worth 4 VP. Each Contested is worth 1 VP
- (Optional Turn 5) - Each Controlled is worth 5 VP. Each Contested is worth 1 VP

*Roll a die at the end of Turn 4, if a [BLOC] is rolled, continue to Turn 5, otherwise game ends.

### Victory Conditions
The winner is the player with the most VPs. If there is a tie, Defender wins.

### Description
This is a typical mission and map for Zverograd, the central area is surrounded by buildings (almost all floors are gone by now, and only empty husks of concrete remain), They provide Cover and are overlooking 4 Objectives (green square with O) of the scenario. The Objectives represent control over the area and you score **Victory Points** (VP) by contesting and controlling them over the course of the game.

### Size of game
This scenario is suitable for Battle to Big Battle size games (80 AP or larger) with 100-120 AP being common. This scenario caters for units with weapon range 12 or higher as they can control fire lanes.

### Deployment
Attacker units enter board from the blue edge. Defender enter the board from the red edge. Standard deployment rules apply (but can be modified as required by the story).

### Terrain
The board has 4 buildings as their main features. The 4 Objectives are open spaces, do not provide Cover and do not block Line of Sight nor prevent Vehicles from entering or passing through. Follow the placement of Objectives as per the map.

**Alternative**: To make it easier for the Defender, move between 1-4 Objectives one square nearer to the Defender deployment edge.

Before Deployment, starting with the Defender, place the following terrain pieces within Range 2 of any Objective but not on the Objective itself, one terrain piece at a time, alternating between players. You cannot place a terrain piece within a building or with another terrain piece. Each tank-trap must be placed such that it is within Range 2 to two Objectives, if it is not possible to do so, replace the tank-trap with an ammo-crate or barbed wire.

Each Player:
- Ammo Crates x 2
- Tank-Traps x 2
- Rubbles x 2

**Alternative**: Defender may substitute up to 2 pieces of terrain for Barbed Wires.

**Alternative**: Ammo Crates can allow you to Replenish limited ammo weapons. The unit must be in or adjacent to the Ammo Crate and spend an Action to do a Replenish Action. The Ammo Crate is destroyed immediately after and removed. *Note this is slightly different from Replenish in the rulebook*

### Objective
Players score VP for controlling or contesting the Objectives as follows:
- Turn 1 - no scoring of VPs.
- Turn 2 onwards, at the end of each Turn, each Controlled Objective is worth 2 VP. Each Contested is worth 1 VP.

### Victory Conditions
- Turn 4 onwards, at the end of each Turn, if one side controls 3 or more Objectives and has more VPs than the other, that side is the winner and game ends. Otherwise game ends at Turn 6 and highest VP wins the game, Defender breaks ties.
