*We provide missions that we think will be fun and thematic for RTZ and for the round, you are not limited to these missions and in fact we believe our players can come up with better scenarios on their own! Contact us with your scenarios, we would love to feature them! When in doubt, always consult your opponent and arrive at a mutually agreeable scenario, giving the advantage to your opponent if there is any uncertainty like a gentleman!*

The Objectives represent control over the area and you score **Victory Points** (VP) by contesting and controlling them over the course of the game.

### Terrain
The board has 4 buildings as their main features. The 2 Objectives can be either open space or terrain pieces that provide Cover but should not block Line of Sight nor prevent Vehicles from entering or passing through.

The 2 Objectives are placed in the centre column, each 5 squares away from the deployment edge as in the diagram above.

**Alternative**: To make it easier for the Defender, move both Objectives one square straight down nearer to the Defender deployment edge.

As part of Deployment step, after Initiative, starting with the Player going first, place the following terrain within your half of the board, one terrain piece at a time, alternating between players. You cannot place a terrain piece within a building or with another terrain piece.

Each Player:
- Ammo Crates x 2
- Tank-Trap x 2

**Alternative**: you may allow the Defender to place 2 more pieces of terrain.

**Alternative**: you may substitute up to 2 pieces of terrain for Barbed Wires or Rubble.

### Objective
Players score VP for controlling or contesting the Objectives as follows:
- Turn 1 - no scoring of VPs.
- Turn 2 - Each Controlled Objective is worth 2 VP. Each Contested is worth 1 VP
- Turn 3 - Each Controlled Objective is worth 3 VP. Each Contested is worth 1 VP
- Turn 4 - Each Controlled Objective is worth 4 VP. Each Contested is worth 1 VP
- (Optional Turn 5) - Each Controlled is worth 5 VP. Each Contested is worth 1 VP

*Roll a die at the end of Turn 4, if a [BLOC] is rolled, continue to Turn 5, otherwise game ends.

An alternative is to remove any of the 3 buildings closer to the Defender from the game. This might be necessary to allow the Defender to move his Huge Vehicle to the Objectives.

There are 3 Objectives. The Objective closest to the Defender edge is a monument which is impassable terrain and blocks Line of Sight.

The other 2 Objectives are open spaces, do not provide Cover and do not block Line of Sight nor prevent Vehicles from entering or passing through. In order to contest/control these Objectives, units must have Line of Sight to them.

There is a small Ammo Dump directly opposite the monument. By default it provides cover like an Ammo Crate.
