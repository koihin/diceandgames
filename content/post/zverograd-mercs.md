Currently there are no mercenary companies operating in Zverograd that is not aligned with one of the major blocs. Any player who chooses to deploy a pure mercenary force must fight under one of the existing bloc for the duration of the campaign.

A mercenary force (100%) operating in Zverograd gets a 15% faction bonus, instead of 10%, rounding up any fraction.

## KV-47 Walkers (all variants)
Due to standardisation, all Mercs KV-47 (including tropical versions) have 5 Health.

## Platoons
**Sister Luisa's Mercenary Platoon - Go Get'em Girls!** has an alternative Platoon Advantage. All mercenary units in or supporting this platoon gain Brave. You may also add a Mercenary Anti-tank Squad OR a Mercenary Machine-gun Squad for free, i.e. they cost 0AP.

**Taskforce Tanya - Dig in Girls** - if fielding this platoon, you may add a Mercenary Anti-tank Squad OR a Mercenary Machine-gun Squad for free, i.e. they cost 0AP.
