The Axis laser weapons are some of the most powerful weapons on the planet, hampered only by their power and engineering requirements. Lasers need to be focused on a point long enough for the laser to burn through, and attenuation limits the effective range. Infantry carried laser weapons especially suffer from the lack of a stable firing platform in combat conditions.

Elite laser grenadiers are expected to be able to operate with iron discipline. Their skills with laser weapons are second to none save Sigrid herself.

**PLATOON ADVANTAGE: Beste vom Besten**

All Laser-armed Blutkreuz infantry units in or supporting the Platoon gain the Brave skill.

All Laser Grenadier Squads in the platoon gain Smoke Grenades.

All Heavy Laser Grenadiers in the platoon gain an extra Heavy Laser Grenadier model to the squad, bringing the number of models and health to 4. The additional Heavy Laser Grenadier is armed in an identical manner to a Heavy Laser Grenadier Squad, i.e. with a Heavy Assault Laser.
