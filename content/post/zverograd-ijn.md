## Known IJN Forces present at Zverograd at the end of August, 1947

*The IJN has somehow managed to infiltrate 2 full company of troops into Zverograd. While much smaller compared to the other blocs, they are fresh troops and seemingly invincible warriors. Rumours abound of sentries found the next day with their throats cut by a bladed weapon, or patrols ambushed by ghosts, only to disappear shortly after. Their intentions are currently unknown but speculation among the various HQs are rife. They are almost certain it relates to the unknown entity beneath the monastery.*

## Faction Bonus
When building a force for RTZ, instead of a 10% faction bonus, you get a 5% faction bonus, rounded up. To make up for this, your missions sometimes has objectives that require you to triumph over larger forces.

## Hero Archetypes
Here is the list of Heroes you may choose as your commander (if it is the command unit of your Core Platoon) or add to your army list. Remember to rename them for the stories! If a Hero is not on the list, you would have to request for it from HQ.

- Akiko
- Fumiko*
- Hitomi
- Kaori
- Shadow Of Death
- Yukiko

*Fumiko's Tactician Skill - how many Pass Tokens you get from the skill depends on the size of battle. For fluff reasons, your Hero will not be at Fumiko's level. But a Kaigun-sh≈çsa at best.

**Patrol size** - Nothing
** Skirmish sizes - 1 Pass Token
** Battle Size. - 2 Pass Token
*** Big Battles - 3 Pass Token
