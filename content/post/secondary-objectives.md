*Secondary Objectives can be a lot fun especially for experienced players. They can spruce up an existing mission/scenario and introduce a layer of strategy that might be the difference between victory and defeat!*

Secondary Objectives can fit into any Mission where you are scoring VPs over X number of Game Turns. Most VPs are scored immediately when you satisfy the objective requirements stated on the card.

Each Secondary Objective will score you 1 VP.

You can never score for the same Secondary Objectives twice, but you can score for Multiple Objectives in the same Game Turn.

Here are Six Secondary Objectives for your use. They are by default open information, and if available to one player is available to the other. As the Rounds progressed we will see new Secondary Objectives as well different ways of using them.

### 1. Hello There

### 2. Now, You Die
