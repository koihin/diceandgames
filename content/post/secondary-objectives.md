*Secondary Objectives can be a lot fun especially for experienced players. They can spruce up an existing mission/scenario and introduce a layer of strategy that might be the difference between victory and defeat!*

Secondary Objectives can fit into any Mission where you are scoring VPs over X number of Game Turns. Most VPs are scored immediately when you satisfy the objective requirements stated on the card.

Each Secondary Objective will score you 1 VP.

You cannot score for the same Secondary Objectives twice, but you can score for Multiple Objectives in the same Game Turn.

Here are the Secondary Objectives for your use. They are by default open information, and if available to one player is available to the other. As the Rounds progressed we will see new Secondary Objectives as well different ways of using them.

## Selection
After placement of terrain, select a number of Secondary Objectives up to the Turn limit from the list below. This forms your Secondary Objective cards pool that you can try to score for during the game. At this point you should know your opponent's army list (unless it is hidden information). Select cards that you think suit the mission and forces.

### 1. Hello There
