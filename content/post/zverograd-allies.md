## Known Allies Forces present at Zverograd at the end of August, 1947
**Ninth Allied Army**
- 1st Mesopotamian Army 4th MAR DIV (Left)*
- 3rd Cavalry Division
- 8th Ranger Battalion

*Allies forces in Zverograd are desperate and de-moralised. The Mythos and new developments has scuppered their plans for a strategic withdrawal from the doomed city. Aid from an unexpected quarter stabilised the situation but the alliance is short-lived. An agreement with mercenary forces has been made, but HQ wonders if this is enough to secure their new objectives...*

*The Marines have mostly left but a few special ops companies remained.

Smaller than division level forces may not be tracked. When creating the backstory for your force you are free to create one that you think fits the narrative. Most forces will be at Platoon size, but remember, you can be at the core of a company that is not fully represented on the tabletop but appears in your story.

Normal army list building rules applies for all factions unless otherwise stated.

## USMC War Dogs Recon squad
{{<figure src="/images/usmc-war-dogs.jpg">}}
A dog may be man's best friend, but last we checked, it isn't a man. War Dogs Recon squad is a 3-men unit, not 5. The dogs are treated as CC weapons.

## Heavy Rangers
{{<figure src="/images/heavy-ranger-attack.jpg">}}
Extensive field usage allowed Allies engineers to correct for structural flaws in their XM-18 series power armour. All Heavy Rangers gain [Structural Save]({{< ref "/post/dust-unified-saves" >}}).

## Bloc Veterans
*The 8th Ranger Battalion has lost a lot of good men over the long months. Those that remained have mastered city-fighting and learn to operate in new platoons. Bringing in Justine & Co. has also boosted morale.*

If fielding an Allies Bloc army (75% bloc, no faction units), the faction bonus is 15% instead of 10%, any fraction is rounded up.

## Partnership with Justine & Co.
{{< figure src="/images/justine-co-special.jpg">}}
*The Allies have awarded a hefty contract to Justine & Co. for maintenance of their various war machines in different theatres. The ladies are popular with the boys both on and off the field.*

If fielding an Allies Bloc army (75% bloc, no faction units) and bringing 2 Vehicles or more where at least one of them is armour class 4 and above, you may add a Justine & Co. Unit for free, i.e. it costs 0AP. You cannot add a Justine & Co. as part of your normal list building. A list will never have more than one Justine & Co. Unit.

The following restrictions apply when using Justine & Co, the Unit will never take an Attack Action, but they will counter-attack in Close Combat as per normal. They can never contest for objectives or score for primary or secondary objectives.

*(If you are thinking, does this mean you can do a Sustained Attack Action then boo on you, play for the fluff, keep the rules lawyering mentality out!)*

*Justine & Co. are well respected by all Blocs (except Mythos). Most commanders will avoid targetting them on purpose, but the girls are aware of the risks out on the field. If news gets around that Justine & Co. are targetted, there may be repercussions...

## Platoons
All platoons are available if you can legally build them. You can have multiple platoons in your force (but must always include your Core Platoon).

[New Allies Combined Rangers Platoon]({{< ref "/post/allies-combined-rangers" >}})

[New Allies Light Assault Walker Platoon]({{< ref "/post/light-assault-walker-platoon" >}})
