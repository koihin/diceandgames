## The story so far...
Story from Round 3 [here]({{< ref "/post/rtz-round-3" >}}).

The third round saw no abatement of combat, now company sized battles dominate, entire battalions got deployed to retake districts.

The big event was the air battle over Zverograd, centred around the Old Town district, where a combined Allies-Axis air force baited the flying monsters airborne and proceeded to firebomb their roosting grounds with a new incendiary weapon that burned for so long the creatures, which could not sustain flight for long, now returned to see their nests burning. Even as they tire and fell out of the sky, highly manoeuvrable jet-fighters of both Allies and Axis forces took on any of them that tried to leave the area. After several successive waves of attack aircrafts, the sky grew quiet as Mi-Gos fell out of the sky to the burning ground or some chose to perish in the sea. For the first time since June, the air over Zverograd is not dominated by flying nightmares.

The SSU were equal part indignant and excited they were not consulted in this joint exercise, yet saw an opportunity to capitalise on the situation by bringing in their own troop carriers in an attempt to quickly drop paratroopers to retake key areas. It was not to be as Axis AA guns in position and caused enough damage the mission was aborted. Zverograd will still have to taken the old-fashioned way.

It is unclear if all the flying creatures were destroyed, half-dead bodies kept being found in different parts of Zverograd, but for now all three major Blocs were committing themselves to bring in air support.

The IJN mounted lightning strikes against mostly SSU locations, but somewhat frustratingly to the SSU they seem not intend on holding on to any location in particular. Reports are made of the day after the IJN successfully occupied a location, they disappeared leaving behind no trace, not even their rubbish. Fear of boobie-traps proved unfound, but rumours persist the IJN never left the area, and stories of ghosts at night and of sentries garrotted as they stood watch. Intelligence indicate the IJN took part in the air battle over Zverograd in some fashion, exactly how they have not been able to determine it.

The Allies were active once more while the Axis held Zverograd airfield became a staging ground for part of the air battle, with planes landing to be re-fueled and re-supplied before taking off again in record time. The few Mi-Gos that attempted to attack the airfield= were taken care of by defensive AA guns.

With this development the various blocs are renewing their efforts, the roar of jetfighters can be heard with the chopping sound from whirling blades of the SSU helicopters added to the mix, and fresh troops are added to reinforce veterans. What will the new phase of the war over the doomed city bring?
