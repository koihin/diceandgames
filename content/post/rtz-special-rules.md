## Unified Saves Rules
Please refer to the [Unified Saves Rules]({{< ref "/post/dust-unified-saves" >}}) for how Saves work in this campaign. For example, Steel Guards can now benefit from Smoke as it confers an Evade Save rather than a Cover Save.

## Height Advantage
*This replaces the Height Advantage rule from the rulebook and FAQ.*
If you are Higher than your target unit by Range 1 or more, your target must re-roll Infantry and Cover Saves (Structural Saves are not affected). If you are Lower by Range 1 or more, your target gains Cover Save.

## Scout
{{<figure src="/images/recon-grenadiers.png">}}
Units with Scout may deploy up to March Move distance before Game Turn 1, after any terrain placement. If so, they do not get to use the Scout ability in Turn 1. Regardless of how many units in your Force has Scout, no more than 3 units may deploy in this manner. The rest will use Scout as per normal.

## Pass Tokens
In conjunction with the rules on Pass Tokens, the following rules applies as well.

1. After a Unit has been activated as a result of attempting a Reactive Attack, player receives 1 Pass token.

2. When a Unit activates another unit (such as when an observer unit activates an artillery unit to Attack), player receives 1 Pass token. Does not apply to reactivation.

## Damage Resilient against Close Combat Attacks
All Vehicles and Infantry class 3 and 4 gain Damage Resilient against CC Attacks.

##Initiative
Before the first Game Turn roll 3 dice for Initiative as usual. If a player has less Units (count Heroes joined to a Unit as 1) than his opponent, he rolls an extra die. The side that rolls the most [BLOC] wins Initiative. The Attacker of the scenario/mission breaks ties.

The winner of the Initiative decides who goes first in the first Game Turn. Keep the same order for Turn 2.

Starting from Turn 3, roll for Initiative at the start of each Turn. The player with less Units rolls an extra die. Again, the Attacker breaks ties.
