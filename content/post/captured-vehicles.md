"All's fair in love and war," or so the saying goes. Resources are scarce on the battlefield, so captured equipment that is intact or requires only minor repair is sometimes pressed into service.

With supply lines stretched thin, this opportunism offers a way to replace badly damaged or destroyed equipment, such as AFVs. The down side to this equipment is that it can be difficult to maintain. Your Platoon's mechanic is likely unfamiliar with the design, any captured manuals are in a foreign language, and replacement parts are only available through salvaging other wrecks, capturing a supply depot, or fabricating them in the field.

Regardless, having one of the enemy's Walkers sure beats having no Walkers on the field of battle and could mean the difference between life and death.

Each player may field only one Captured Vehicle in its force. Vehicles are the only Captured Units allowed in Dust 1947. You may not include Captured Squads, Aircraft, or Heroes in your force.

The Captured Vehicle has the characteristics shown on its Unit Card except that its army point increase by 1 (for the RTZ campaign).

Axis
• Heinrich and Heinrich Trop
• Loth
• Luther
• Ludwig
• Flamm-Luther
• JagdLuther

Allies
• Allied Wildfire
• Allied Mickey and Mickey Light
• Allied Pounder and Pounder Light
• Allied Skysweeper

SSU Nadya
• SSU Natalya
• SSU Natasha and Natasha (Tsh)
• SSU Nikita
• SSU Aleksei
• SSU Red Fury

For the RTZ campaign, due to the long period of close proximity, and the need to improvise when resources were scarce, using whatever vehicles you can get your hands on became a necessity.
