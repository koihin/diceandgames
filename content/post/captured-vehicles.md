"All's fair in love and war," or so the saying goes. Resources are scarce on the battlefield, so captured equipment that is intact or requires only minor repair is sometimes pressed into service.

With supply lines stretched thin, this opportunism offers a way to replace badly damaged or destroyed equipment, such as AFVs. The down side to this equipment is that it can be difficult to maintain. Your Platoon's mechanic is likely unfamiliar with the design, any captured manuals are in a foreign language, and replacement parts are only available through salvaging other wrecks, capturing a supply depot, or fabricating them in the field.

Regardless, having one of the enemy's Walkers sure beats having no Walkers on the field of battle and could mean the difference between life and death.

Each player may field only one Captured Vehicle in its force. Only the Vehicles in the list below may be fielded as a Captured Vehicle.

The Captured Vehicle has the characteristics shown on its Unit Card except that its army point increase by 1 (for the RTZ campaign).

Axis
* Heinrich and Heinrich Trop
* Loth
* Luther
* Ludwig
* Flamm-Luther
* JagdLuther

Allies
* Wildfire
* Mickey (Mickey Light)
* Pounder (Pounder Light)
* Skysweeper

SSU
* Nadya
* Natalya
* Natasha (Natasha (Tsh))
* Nikita
* Aleksei
* Red Fury
* **Assaulter***

For the RTZ campaign, due to the long period of close proximity, and the need to improvise when resources were scarce, using whatever vehicles you can get your hands on became a necessity.

*Aircraft are high maintenance vehicles. SSU mechanics are able to push their machines to the max due to their intimate knowledge of their machines. When captured, the amount of components held together by tape and wires makes most men shake their heads in disbelief.

All captured Assaulters are armour class 1 instead of 2.

The Assaulter is unavailable to the IJN forces due to logistics limitation and the RTZ campaign.
