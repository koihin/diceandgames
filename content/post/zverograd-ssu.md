## Known Allies Forces present at Zverograd at the end of August, 1947
**Army Group “Caspian”**  
- 13th Red Banner Army
- 10th SSU Rifle Division
- 1st Guard Motor Rifle Division
- 3rd Red Guards Division
- 666th Separate Special Purpose Brigade

*Note: The SSU has moved so many forces in and out of Zverograd with so many independent operations that more than once there has been 'friendly fire' incidents that even the commanders on the ground do not know for sure all the forces that are operating.*

Smaller than division level forces may not be tracked. When creating the backstory for your force you are free to create one that you think fits the narrative. Most forces will be at Platoon size, but remember, you can be at the core of a company that is not fully represented on the tabletop but appears in your story. There has been so many organisational changes over the years that companies and battalions can vary wildly in size, some companies are no bigger than a large platoon.

## KV-47 Walkers (all variants)
{{<figure src="/images/kv47-array.png">}}
*With the success of the KV-47 series of nimble walkers, the need to standardise production became essential as VK is a highly fought over resource within the different factions of the SSU.*

With the exception of Koshka's Grand'ma, all KV-47s (including tropical variants) now have 5 Health instead of 6.

## Steel Guards
Instead of the awkward wording of their Save (an Infantry Save but with exceptions), replace the Steel Guards Infantry Save with an [Improved Structural Save]({{< ref "/post/dust-unified-saves" >}}). It is almost identical in how it works.

## Platoons
All platoons are available if you can legally build them unless otherwise noted below. You can have multiple platoons in your force (but must always include your Core Platoon).

**SSU Red Guards Platoon: Platoon Advantage** is modified as follows:

If Attacker: During the first *3* Game Turns, roll a die each time a soldier is eliminated from a Red Guards Infantry Unit, On a roll of [BLOC] a replacement comes forward and the Soldier is returned to play. Does not apply to Heroes joined to Unit.

If Defender: During the first *2* Game Turns, roll a die each time a soldier is eliminated from a Red Guards Infantry Unit, On a roll of [BLOC] a replacement comes forward and the Soldier is returned to play. Does not apply to Heroes joined to Unit.

If playing a series of linked games that happens immediately one after another, the advantage only applies in the first game.

**Koshka's SMERSH KV-47 Platoon** is not available as airdrop operations are currently not possible. This may change in the coming Game Rounds.

**Yakov's Stormwall Platoon** is only available to SSU Bloc forces (no faction units) and only if the SSU Bloc force starts the game as the defender (for multiple linked games using the same force over the same location, if the force becomes the Attacker it loses this Platoon Advantage).



## Hero Archetypes
