Dice & Games (D&G) was founded on the vision to bring tabletop gaming fun to communities everywhere. We are an offshoot and sister site to Singapore Open Gaming (SOG), singaporeopengaming.com where we have organised many gaming sessions and community events for over 15 years. SOG will continue to focus on the community and a non-profit outlook while D&G will have commercial offerings and partnerships.
