Dice & Games (D&G) was founded on the vision to bring joy to people through tabletop games. We are a sister site to [Singapore Open Gaming](https://singaporeopengaming.com) (SOG) which has organised many gaming sessions and community events in Singapore for over 15 years.

SOG focuses on the community and a communal outlook while D&G will have commercial offerings and partnerships.
